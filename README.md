# Research-Papers-Highlights

As a Machine Learning Engineer, I have always wished it would be better if I can read and understand the key points of a research paper in less than 5 mins. In this attempt, I will be uploading papers with the key concepts and observations highlighted. I believe this would help someone who is out there who wishes to quickly understand a research article just like me. 

My area of interest and primary focus would be papers from NLP
